                    My career goal is to work as a technical lead on an application development team. This will provide me with opportunities to learn new tools and techniques to further my career as an IT professional.  I am looking to learn more about newer technologies as well as how to efficiently write code to make it modular, reusable, and maintainable.  I enjoy working on web applications and building RESTful microservices for data operations and access.

                    I began learning computer science when I was in middle school and messed around with command line and building servers to learn more.  From there I taught myself how to write simple web applications using PHP, MySQL, HTML and Javascript due to my high school having no technical courses for me to learn more.  Because I enjoyed it so much, I decided to study Computer Science in my undergrad studies at Endicott College.  After college I worked for three years before deciding to return to school for my masters degree at Boston University.
